## Project Setup Instructions
The website comprises of 5 pages that include the:
1. *The Home Page*
2. *The Why us section with the head title 'Eat Together'*
3. *The Menu section*
4. *The Hot Deals section*
5. *The Contact Us section*

The page also is scroll-enabled which allow one to scroll to whichever section one wants apart from having the option to use the navigation tab on top of the page.
